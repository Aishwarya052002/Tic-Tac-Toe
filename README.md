# Tic-Tac-Toe

Introduction:
  The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player game where players 
  alternately mark a 3X3 grid with their symbols typically “x” and 
  “O”.The goal is to place three of one’s own symbols in a horizontal, 
  vertical or diagonal row to win the game.
  This project aims to develop a web-based version of Tic-tac-toe
  leveraging modern web technologies to provide an engaging user 
  experience.

  
Objectives:
  ▪ Develop a fully functional Tic-tac-toe Game: Create an 
  interactive game that allows two players to take turns and play 
  Tic-tac-toe on a 3X3 grid.
  ▪ Implement win and Draw Logic: Ensure the game can detect 
  and declare winners or a draw based on standard Tic-tac-toe
  rules.
  ▪ Score Tracking: Maintain and display scores for each player 
  and the number of draws.
  ▪ User Interface Design: Provide an intuitive visually appealing 
  interface for players.
  ▪ Reset Functionality: Allow players to reset the game, clearing 
  the board and restarting the score tally.
